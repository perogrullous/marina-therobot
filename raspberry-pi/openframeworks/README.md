# Open Frameworks

## A word about openframeworks


## why of (open frameworks)?
Well, thats the initial plan. 
I would like to perform some image processing, from the raspberry pi camera. 
The goal is to use a library such as Aruco in order to detect "qr-like" markers and help 
Marina to determine its own position based on these markers. Image processing libraries are CPU eager and being 
openframeworks based on C++ and compiled, I hope the poor pi to have power enought to be able to handle them.
